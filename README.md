# fumblerooski
A College Football App


This is mainly an app I built to combine my passion for college football and web development. 
It utilizes MySQL for the database, Node/TypeScript and Express for the server, with React, Redux, and Tailwind on the front end.

## Purpose

The main vision of this app was a dashboard for every team in college football. There are some sites out there that provide great information but don't have a great user experience or are rather dull to look at. I wanted to create something that I would use myself and so I decided to create fumblerooski: a modern college football app using modern web technologies. 

The original vision was just a simple dashboard based on team. However, it has quickly expanded into game matchups, recruiting, and tracking other metrics such as PPA and SP+ that are up and coming in the college football world.

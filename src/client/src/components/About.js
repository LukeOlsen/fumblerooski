        <p>So why a college football app?</p>
        <p>
          I created this app because I wanted to make a personal project that
          combined two of my biggest passions: college football and technology.
          I mainly did this as a project for me to work on while I was enjoying
          the college football season. If anyone else enjoys it that would be
          great too but if not that's okay.

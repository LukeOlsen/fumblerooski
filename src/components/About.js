            <h2>The world's only college football app</h2>

            <p>So why a college football app?</p>
            <p>I created this app because I wanted to make a personal project that combined two of my biggest passions: college football and technology.
                I mainly did this as a project for me to work on while I was enjoying the college football season. If anyone else enjoys it that would be great too 
                but if not that's okay.
